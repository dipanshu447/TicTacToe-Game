## 🚀 My Journey 

This project took me around 6 days to complete. I started with a basic player vs player mode and gradually expanded the game. Implementing the computer player logic was a particularly fun challenge. Along the way, I also learned a lot about:

- Writing efficient JavaScript logic.

- Improving UI/UX with smooth transitions.

- Adding audio for a better gaming experience.

- Implementing light/dark mode themes.

- Creating a responsive design using CSS.

It was a fantastic learning experience, and I’m proud of how it turned out!
